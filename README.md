## What is DaVinci Helper?

**DaVinci Helper** is a companion app that simplifies the installation and use of BlackMagic DaVinci Resolve (both Free and Studio versions) on Linux.  
The app is written in Python and features a modern GTK4 + Adwaita interface.

> **Currently, DaVinci Helper officially supports only Fedora Linux** (all spins and derivatives).  
> If the project receives good feedback, I plan to release a version for Debian-based systems like Ubuntu and Linux Mint.
